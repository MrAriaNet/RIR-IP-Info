# RIR-IP-Info
This project provides a Python script to process IP ranges from various Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). It allows you to fetch and display IP Prefixes (IPv4, IPv6) and, optionally, organization information associated with these IP ranges. The script supports multiple RIRs, including RIPE NCC, AFRINIC, APNIC, LACNIC, and ARIN.
