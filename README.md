# RIR-IP-Info
This project provides a Python script to process IP ranges from various Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). It allows you to fetch and display IP Prefixes (IPv4, IPv6) and, optionally, organization information associated with these IP ranges. The script supports multiple RIRs, including RIPE NCC, AFRINIC, APNIC, LACNIC, and ARIN.

This project is useful for network administrators, researchers, and IT professionals who need to analyze and manage IP address allocations across different regions. By providing an automated way to fetch and process IP range data and associated organization information, the script simplifies the task of managing IP resources and understanding their distribution. It helps in network planning, IP address management, and provides insights into the organizations that own specific IP ranges.
